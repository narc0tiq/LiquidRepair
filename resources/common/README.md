**LiquidRepair** is a [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) addon for [Tinker's
Construct](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct) that adds a repair
table capable of repairing tinker tools using molten metal (of the appropriate
type).


## Compiling ##

To compile this mod, you will need a working MCP + Forge +
[MCPDeobfuscate](https://github.com/FunnyMan3595/mcp_deobfuscate) install with
[MCPInterface](https://github.com/FunnyMan3595/mcp_interface) plugged in.
Instructions for that are in the README.txt files provided in the projects.

You will also need to provide Tinker's Construct, either as a library or as a
project dependency. The former is probably easier.


## Jenkins Builds ##

Prebuilt packages of **LiquidRepair** are available for
[1.5.2](http://ci.narc.ro/job/LiquidRepair-1.5/), and will be available for
later Minecraft versions once closer to completion.
